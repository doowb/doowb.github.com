[![octobox.js demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doowb/octobox.js/master/docs/demo.png)](https://octoboxjs.io)

I published a new project last night called [octobox.js](https://github.com/doowb/octobox.js) that's a [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) project using [express](http://expressjs.com/), [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), and [sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/v3/) instead of Ruby on Rails and ActiveDirectory.

The code can be found on GitHub at [https://github.com/doowb/octobox.js](https://github.com/doowb/octobox.js) and the application is hosted on Heroku at [https://octoboxjs.io](https://octoboxjs.io).

I'll be documenting the process that I took to port the application and the libraries that I had to use and/or create to provide similar features to the original Ruby on Rails application.
